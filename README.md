# Data Pipeline: Writing Blockchain Data to Google BigQuery

We set up a pipeline using Bitquery real-time GraphQL subscriptions.

We will use a subscription query, integrate Google Pub/Sub, create subscribers, and then set up a BigQuery table to receive data from one of those Pub/Sub subscribers.

This is just a sample setupâ€”you can use any intermediary to feed data into Google BigQuery or any other cloud database.
